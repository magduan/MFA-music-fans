## What is MyFavoriteAlbums?

MyFavoriteAlbums is a web-based application that allows you to upload a file containing your favorite albums and automatically creates an [interactive webpage](https://cholstro.shinyapps.io/shiny-music/) based on that data. The resulting webpage includes a dashboard that lets you explore your musical trends over the years using built-in filters and graphs.

- **Explore number one albums by year range:** View and analyze your number one ranked albums across any span of years.
- **Filter by artist/band:** See all your favorite albums from a specific artist/band at a glance. 
- **View favorite albums from a specific year:** Focus on a single year to view your favorite albums from that time. 
- **Track vinyl ownership and trends:**  Identify which top-rated albums you do not yet own on vinyl, and see a ranked breakdown of the years from which you own the most vinyl records. 
- **Compare artist/bands side-by-side:**  Select two artists/bands and compare how you have rated their albums over time.

## Features Not Included in MyFavoriteAlbums
